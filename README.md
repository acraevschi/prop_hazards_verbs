# HMM Irregularity 

Continuous Hidden Time Markov Chain for tracking the evolution of irregularity, namely Paul's principle, in the evolution of High German's strong verbs. The principle states that verbs that have high degree of irregularity (vowel and consonant alternations in stem) are less likely to regularize than verbs that have only some degree of irregularity (vowel or consonant alternation in the stem).

To proceed with the code, create a new Anaconda environment with `python=3.11`. You can do that by calling `conda create -n <ENV_NAME> python=3.11`. After which, you should activate the environment with `conda activate <ENV_NAME>` and install `R=4.4`. For the latter, call `conda install -c conda-forge r-base=4.4`. Finally, you should be able to install RStan by calling `conda install -c conda-forge r-rstan` and this should take care of C++ toolchain too.
